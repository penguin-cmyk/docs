#### What is this about?

This is just a simple list of explanations on how stuff in the Roblox cheating scene works that I wrote myself out of simple curiosity and also to maybe interest others in this topic. 

It is NOT a in-depth reversal of the inner workings of Roblox it is just explanations on how to utilize stuff.

#### A small disclaimer for the internal side of these explanations. 

I myself don't make internals so much of the information about internals is retrieved from other sources and may not directly go in-depth on why you need to do stuff. It is just a simple explanation on how to do stuff.

The sources / help I got everything from is always credited at the end. So this is new for me as well and I don't think most people will learn much from the internal side of the documentation it was just for me to understand the basics.
